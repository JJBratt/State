## 📖 Overview
State is a C++ compile-time state machine tool. It uses a transition table and supports entry iteration. It is still in development, but it shows great promise for building efficient state machines. This application can aid programmers in designing clear, structured flows within their projects.

## 🌟 Features
- **Compile-Time State Machine:** Reduces runtime errors by ensuring state transitions are verified during compilation.
- **Transition Table:** Organizes state changes clearly, making it easier to understand logic flow.
- **User-Friendly:** Designed for ease of use, even for those with limited programming backgrounds.
- **Educational Tool:** Great for learners who want to understand state machines and meta-programming in C++.
- **Active Development:** Regular updates and enhancements based on user feedback.

## ⚙️ System Requirements
To run State, ensure your system meets these basic requirements:
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **C++ Compiler:** A modern C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang (version 11 or above recommended)
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM for development purposes
- **Storage:** 100 MB of free space to store your files

## 📚 Using State
State provides an intuitive interface to create state machines.

### Create a New State Machine
1. Click on "New State Machine."
2. Define your states and transitions in the provided fields. Use clear names to identify each state’s purpose.

### Editing States
- Select a state to edit its properties.
- You can change the name, add transitions, or remove states as needed.

### Testing Your State Machine
Use the built-in testing feature to simulate your state transitions. This allows you to check for errors and ensure everything functions as expected before implementation.

## 💡 Tips for High-Quality State Machines
- **Keep It Simple:** Avoid overcomplicating your state machine. Use fewer states but ensure they effectively cover all necessary scenarios.
- **Use Descriptive Names:** Name your states clearly to make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand.
- **Document Transitions:** Write notes on why certain transitions exist. This documentation aids in future updates.
